### Linked List Components <1>
### Description<h2>
> We are given head, the head node of a linked list containing unique integer values.  
> We are also given the list G, a subset of the values in the linked list.  
> Return the number of connected components in G, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.
```
Example 1:

Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3
G = [0, 1, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
```
```
Example 2:

Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3->4
G = [0, 3, 1, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
```
### Note:<h3>
- If N is the length of the linked list given by head, 1 <= N <= 10000.
- The value of each node in the linked list will be in the range [0, N - 1].
- 1 <= G.length <= 10000.
- G is a subset of all values in the linked list.
### Solution<h4>
- What is needed is to judge whether the node has been in the List
- As long as the node exists in the List, that means the elements before are all connected.
- Therefore, we just need to count how many asserts(node) by comparing the **List** and **G**
- During the coding proccess, I tried to add 1 once I meet an assert, but that's wrong.
- So, attention, **res** should be added with **flag**,not **1**
### New Skills get√ ：<h6>
> by adding following code can accelerate the program.
```C++
static auto x = [](){
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    return 0;
}();
```
### Codes<h5>
```C++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
static auto x = [](){
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    return 0;
}();
class Solution {
public:
    int numComponents(ListNode* head, vector<int>& G) {
        unordered_set<int> set_(G.begin(),G.end());
        int res=0;
        int flag=0;
        for(;head!=NULL;head=head->next)
        {
            if(set_.count(head->val))
            {
                flag=1;
            }
            else
            {
                res+=flag;
                flag=0;
            }
        }
        return res+flag;
    }
};
```
