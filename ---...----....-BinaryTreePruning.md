### Binary Tree Pruning <h1>
### Description<h2>
> We are given the head node root of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.  
> Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.  
> (Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)  
```
Example 1:
Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
Explanation: 
Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
The diagram on the right represents the answer.

### Solution <h3>
> traver the hole binary tree  
> as long as the value is 0, and the left and the right are both NULL, just return NULL
### Codes<h4>
```C++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* pruneTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root==NULL)return NULL;
        TreeNode* left=root->left;
        TreeNode* right=root->right;
        left=pruneTree(root->left);
        right=pruneTree(root->right);
        root->left=left;
        root->right=right;
        if(left==NULL && right==NULL && root->val==0) root= NULL;
        return root;        
    }
