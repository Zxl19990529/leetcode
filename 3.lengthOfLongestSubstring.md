### LengthOfLongestSubstring<h1>
### Description<h2>
```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
### Method<h3>
- Providing that, we search the stirng from the head, then we can judge weather the current char has been in the vector we have checked before. If it has, then set the counts 0, and make this char as the head and continue;  
- However, take "abcabcbb" and "dvedf" as example, if we search as before, "dvedf" should return 3,because"dve" is the longest. Therefore, to correctly find out the answer 4, which is "vedf", we should update the head from 'd' to 'v'. Â  
-The following is the solution.
### Code<h4>
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        if (s.length() == 1)
			return 1;
        int counts=0;
        int m=0;
        int size=s.length();
        int pos_1,pos_2;
        pos_1=0;
        for (int j = 0; j < size; j++)
		{
			pos_1 = j;
			m = m < counts ? counts : m;
			counts = 0;
			for (int i = j; i < size; i++)
			{
				
				pos_2 = i;
				char a = s[i];
				bool ok = IfHasHad(pos_1, pos_2, s, a);
				if (ok)
				{
					pos_1 = i;
					m = m < counts ? counts : m;
					counts = 1;
				}
				else
					counts++;
			}
		}
        m = m < counts ? counts : m;
        return m;
    }
    
    
    bool IfHasHad(int pos_1,int pos_2,string s,char a)
    {
        
        for(int i=pos_1;i<pos_2;i++)
        {
            if(s[i]==a)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    int max(int a,int b)
    {
        return a>b?a:b;
    }
};
```
