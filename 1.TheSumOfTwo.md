### Title <h1>
>Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
### Example <h2>
>Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

>Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,

>return [0, 1].

- This is my first time to use vector;
- Considering most problems here links with vector<int>nums, I have to learn vector particularly
### Codes as follows: <h3>
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int flag=0;
    static vector<int> sum(2);
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size()-1 ; i++)
	{
		for (int j = i+1; j < nums.size(); j++)
		{
			if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target)
			{
				sum[0] = i;
				sum[1] = j;
				flag = 1;
				break;
			}
		}
		if (flag == 1)break;
	}
    return sum;
    }
};
```
